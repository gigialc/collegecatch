           <h1>HOW I CUFFED A FRAT BOY MY FRESHMAN YEAR</h1>
                <h2>by Gigi Alcaraz</h2>
            <p>We have all heard the phrase "oh no wonder why he is not committing, he is a frat boy", and that is exactly what I believed when I first came to BU. 
            I despised that stereotypical "frat boy" but I could have not been further from reality.  </p>
    
    <br>
            
              <h2>How I did it</h2>
           <ul>
           <li>Never assumed or expected anything from him</li>
           <li>Did not need his attention to have a fun time</li>
           <li>Communicated what I wanted really clearly and confidently</li>
           <li>Made sure he knew that I was not dependant on anyone</li>
           <li>Spent a lot of quality time with him</li>
           <li>NEVER texted first</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>BEING OPEN TO MEET NEW PEOPLE</h2>
            <p>I think that the first mistake many people make when coming to collage is that they tend to 
            stick to the people they know and that are part of their usual circle, in other words people who are familiar to them but that
            is a mistake because you miss out on a lot of great people. Many use tinder but won't talk to the cute bot who sits two rows in front at their class.
            It is so important to not judge people only based on your first impression because you never know. Personality is what makes you fall in love and I know
            it sounds cliche but it is true.  </p>
