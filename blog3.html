           <h1>5 Modern Dating Definitions You Need To Know </h1>
            <p>In today’s dating scene, it seems that new terminology is continually being created to describe the most current dating trends. For example, talk of ghosts used to be limited to Halloween and the dead; however, the term “ghosting” now holds a whole new meaning. With horror stories of daters who’ve experienced “gaslighting,” “zombie-ing,” and “benching” becoming more and more common, it can be scary to form new relationships with people online without being able to understand what they mean. Undoubtedly, it seems as though dating has become more of a rhetorical challenge than a romantic one - so we’ve rounded up five of the most popular terms to help you become dating-literate and recognize when they might be happening to you!</p>

                <li class="reveal"><h2>Ghosting </h2>
                    <p>In dating, ghosting is when a match who you have been speaking to or dating for a while suddenly ends all contact without explanation - profile unmatched, messages unanswered, calls avoided. The main cause of ghosting is usually that the ghoster has lost interest. Ghosting may feel like a gentler way to spare someone’s feelings, but silence will actually cause more pain than intended. </p>
                     
                <li class="reveal"><h2>Zombie-ing </h2>
                    <p>If you’ve been ghosted, the offender may come back from the dead - months or years after they disappeared. This is called zombie-ing.  The culprits usually act like nothing happened, like an arrogant re-animated corpse. A sudden “hey” might pop-up on your phone or laptop, or something similar that will tempt you to reply. Most of the time, the zombie will try to get back into your life by following you and liking your posts on social media. </p></li>
                <li class="reveal"><h2>Benching</h2>
                    <p>Before you have the “exclusive talk” with your new love interest about whether you are only  seeing each other, you may fall into the trap of being “benched.” Derived from the sports term, where players on the bench are left as reserves, you might find yourself continually being the back-up option as they continue to date around. Not what you want to get yourself into? </p></li>
				
                <li class="reveal"><h2>Negging </h2>
                    <p>Negging is when someone insults you and undermines your self-esteem as a cruel and twisted way to make you more susceptible to their romantic advances. For example, they may throw you a “you need to lose a few,” before telling you that it’s okay though because they can be “into that.” Needless to say, it’s a harmful and dismissive way to treat someone and it needs to stop. Negging can only work on people who already have low confidence. </p></li>

                <li class="reveal"><h2>Gaslighting </h2>
                    <p>Gaslighting is when someone does or says something, and later tells you it didn’t happen the way you remember it or even happen at all. The origin of this term comes from the 1944 film “Gaslight”,  in which a husband manipulates his wife into believing she’s going insane. This is an extremely serious issue and is often carried out by narcissists.</p></li>
